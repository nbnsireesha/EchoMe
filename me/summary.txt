Career break after USAA experence: Dedicated time for personal growth and family establishment during maternity break. This period included intentional upskilling in [mention technical skills like AWS, Python, Agentic AI], allowing for a renewed and expanded technical foundation. Successfully managed a demanding personal schedule to remain current with industry advancements and cultivate essential soft skills in time management, prioritization, and resilience.

Relocating: I'm prefer staying in Denver, CO area and open to Colorado Springs, CO

As a frontend engineer with over five years of experience, I’ve always been passionate about
crafting web applications that not only perform well but also delight users. At USAA, I took
pride in building interactive, data-driven applications that improved engagement and streamlined
workflows. My expertise spans technologies like React, Java, Python, GraphQL, and modern
JavaScript frameworks, all of which I used to design and maintain scalable, intuitive user
interfaces. Collaborating closely with product managers and designers, I also brought concepts to
life using design systems like Figma, ensuring a perfect balance of form and function.
One of the moments that shaped my love for frontend development was working on a budgeting
tool and monthly expense chart project. Designing these features to help users visualize and
manage their finances in an intuitive and interactive way was incredibly rewarding. Seeing how
these tools empowered users to make informed financial decisions reinforced my belief in the
importance of creating user-friendly digital experiences.


Throughout my career, I have been passionate about building scalable and high-performance web applications. At USAA, I played a key role in developing interactive, data-driven interfaces using React, Next.js, and TypeScript while collaborating closely with product managers and designers to enhance user experiences. My expertise in building reusable React components, optimizing performance, and implementing testing frameworks such as Playwright and Jest aligns well with Respondology’s need for a front-end-focused engineer. Additionally, my experience working with GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and back-end frameworks like Node.js and Ruby on Rails equips me with the versatility needed to contribute across the stack.

Designing these features to help users visualize and manage their finances in an intuitive and interactive way was incredibly rewarding. Seeing how these tools empowered users to make informed financial decisions reinforced my belief in the importance of creating user-friendly digital experiences.
I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of Respondology’s commitment to leveraging technology for good. The idea of developing solutions that not only enhance brand engagement but also promote healthy online interactions resonates deeply with my values as a developer. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can take ownership of projects, innovate, and work alongside cross-functional teams to drive impactful results.


In my previous full stack role, I worked across both the React frontend and Java backend, taking ownership of end-to-end feature delivery. My responsibilities included designing clean and intuitive UIs, collaborating closely with product owners and solution architects to gather and refine requirements, and working with API developers to assess feasibility, define boundaries, and provide accurate effort estimates.

I was actively involved in Agile practices such as sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog refinement, PI planning, and code reviews. I played a hands-on role in all these ceremonies, contributing to continuous improvement and ensuring delivery stayed aligned with business goals.

On the production side, I participated in pilot user support, production releases, and 24/7 on-call rotations. I used tools like Kibana, Grafana, OpenShift, and Datadog to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly, minimizing downtime and impact.

Since I’ve worked in a fully remote environment, I strongly believe in over-communication — keeping managers and coworkers in the loop through clear updates and active collaboration. I document all processes we follow and log anything new we try as a team, which helps unblock future work and brings transparency to how we operate.

In addition, I regularly participate in Lunch & Learn sessions, where our team shares knowledge across domains — helping everyone grow their skills and understand the broader technical landscape we're working in.

Overall, I bring a balance of technical depth, ownership, communication, and team enablement — all of which are critical in today’s distributed product teams.

Currently, my skill set includes a robust foundation in:
HTML | CSS | JavaScript | jQuery | Git | XML | JSON | NodeJS | Java | MongoDB | MYSQL

I am presently in the process of acquiring proficiency in:
Agentic AI, Python

While I have achieved significant milestones, I remain acutely aware that an ongoing journey of learning, problem-solving, and personal growth stretches infinitely ahead.
